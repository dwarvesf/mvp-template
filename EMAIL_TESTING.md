# Email Service Testing Guide

## âœ… Current Status: Fully Implemented & Working

The email service integration is complete and successfully tested. Here's how to test it:

## Quick Test Commands

### 1. Password Reset Email
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/auth/forgot-password \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"mvp@example.com"}'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{"message":"If the email exists, a reset link will be sent"}
```

**Expected Console Output:**
```
ðŸ“§ MOCK EMAIL PROVIDER - Email Sent
Password Reset Request
Hi MVP User, You requested to reset your password...
```

### 2. Member Invitation Email
```bash
# Get auth token
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:4000/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"mvp@example.com","password":"Pwd123!"}' | jq -r '.accessToken')

# Send invitation
curl -X POST "http://localhost:4000/organizations/cmevk71h10039ruk0phyd91qn/invitations" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","roleId":"cmevk7139000jruk0mgs3jwqb"}'
```

**Expected Console Output:**
```
ðŸ“§ MOCK EMAIL PROVIDER - Email Sent
Team Invitation
Hi there, MVP User has invited you to join MVP User's Workspace as a owner...
```

## Email Provider Configuration

### Current Setup (Development)
```env
EMAIL_PROVIDER=mock
EMAIL_FROM=hello@yourdomain.com
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### Production with Resend
```env
EMAIL_PROVIDER=resend
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_actual_api_key
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@yourdomain.com
```

### Production with SendGrid
```env
EMAIL_PROVIDER=sendgrid
SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.your_actual_api_key
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@yourdomain.com
```

## Architecture Benefits

âœ… **Provider Agnostic** - Switch providers with just environment variables  
âœ… **Mock Provider** - Perfect for development and testing  
âœ… **Production Ready** - Resend and SendGrid implementations  
âœ… **Retry Logic** - Automatic retries with exponential backoff  
âœ… **Template System** - HTML and text email templates  
âœ… **Type Safe** - Full TypeScript support  

## Email Templates Implemented

1. **PASSWORD_RESET** - Password reset with secure token
2. **MEMBER_INVITATION** - Team invitations with role information  
3. **EMAIL_VERIFICATION** - Email verification for new users
4. **WELCOME** - Welcome emails for onboarding

## Integration Points

- **Password Reset**: `/auth/forgot-password` endpoint automatically sends emails
- **Member Invitations**: Organization invitation flow sends emails to new members
- **Business Logic**: Zero changes needed when switching email providers

## Troubleshooting

If emails aren't appearing in console:
1. Check `EMAIL_PROVIDER=mock` in `.env`
2. Restart the API server
3. Look for "Email service initialized with Mock provider" in logs
4. Verify API is running on port 4000

The email service is production-ready! ðŸš€
